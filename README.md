![image text](Test3/12.jpg)

I am a graduat student from USTC.

I am looking for a pH.D position in UK.

## What I am doing now?

The past two weeks’ work The truncation of mHCFC2 374-712 is obtained with crystal and has been displayed with Pymol. It is not a perfect data after processed with CCP4 and Phoenix and still needs more refinement and even a new raw data. Do some work about yeast two hybrid. Activating Y187 and Y2H strain, order medium and refresh plasmid. I did the co-IP test about mTRIM46 and mHCFC2 and get confused results, it seems the protein mTRIM46 and mHCFC2 are not well expressed. I checked the plasmids and re-extracted them.

The next two weeks’ work To refine the crystal structure of mHCFC2 374-712 and optimism they crystals. To express re-extracted plasmids in 293T cell.

### Thoughts about today

Keep going.
